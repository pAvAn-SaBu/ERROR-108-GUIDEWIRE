### AI-Powered Parametric Insurance for Gig Delivery Workers

---

## 1. Persona & Scenario

### Persona
**Rahul – Food Delivery Partner (Swiggy)**  
Location: Bangalore  
Average daily work: 8 hours  
Average weekly income: ₹6000

### Scenario
On a normal day Rahul completes deliveries and earns his full income. However, during extreme rainfall or severe pollution:
- Delivery demand drops
- Orders reduce
- Rahul cannot work full hours

**Example:**  
Normal day income → ₹1000  
Heavy rain day income → ₹300  
**Income loss → ₹700**  
Revo detects the disruption automatically and **provides compensation for the lost income**.

## 2. Application Workflow

1. **Worker Onboarding** — Delivery workers register using their location, platform details, and payment information.
2. **Risk Profiling** — AI models analyze environmental risks associated with the worker's location.
3. **Policy Selection** — Workers choose a weekly insurance plan.
4. **Real-Time Monitoring** — The system continuously monitors environmental conditions through external APIs.
5. **Parametric Trigger Detection** — When disruption thresholds are exceeded, the system automatically triggers a claim.
6. **Fraud Verification** — Fraud detection algorithms validate the worker's location and activity.
7. **Instant Payout** — Compensation is sent via UPI or a payment gateway.

## 3. Weekly Premium Model

Gig workers earn on a weekly basis, so Revo uses a **weekly subscription-based insurance model**.  
Weekly Premium = Base Premium + Risk Adjustment

| Plan | Weekly Premium | Coverage |
|------|----------------|----------|
| Basic | ₹30 | ₹1000 |
| Standard | ₹50 | ₹2000 |
| Premium | ₹70 | ₹3000 |

*Premiums may vary depending on location risk and historical disruption patterns.*

## 4. Parametric Triggers

Revo uses **parametric triggers** based on measurable external conditions instead of manual claims.

| Event | Trigger Condition |
|-------|-------------------|
| Heavy Rain | Rainfall exceeds city-specific threshold |
| Extreme Heat | Temperature above safe working level |
| Air Pollution | AQI exceeds safe limit |
| Curfew / Zone Closure | Government restriction detected |

To avoid hardcoding thresholds, Revo uses **historical weather percentiles and anomaly detection models** to identify extreme environmental conditions.

---

## 5. Platform Choice: Mobile Application

Revo will be implemented primarily as a **mobile application**.  
Gig workers interact with delivery platforms mainly through smartphones, making mobile the most accessible platform.

**Advantages:**
- Easy onboarding and policy management
- Real-time notifications about disruptions and payouts
- GPS-based location validation for fraud prevention
- Seamless integration with UPI payments
- Higher adoption among gig workers

The backend architecture will support both mobile and web interfaces, but the primary user experience will be **mobile-first**.

## 6. AI / ML Integration

AI plays a central role in the Revo platform.

### Risk Prediction
AI models analyze historical environmental and disruption data to estimate location-based risk scores (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).  
**Output:** Risk score (0–1)

### Dynamic Premium Calculation
Premium pricing is adjusted based on location risk. Lower risk area = lower premium; high risk area = higher premium.

### Anomaly Detection for Disruptions
AI models (Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM) detect abnormal conditions such as unusual rainfall or pollution spikes.

### Fraud Detection
Models identify suspicious activity: GPS spoofing, fake location reporting, duplicate claims, or worker inactivity during disruption.
